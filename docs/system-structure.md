## Resource Organization

### How Resources are Stored
1. When a teacher adds a resource:
   - The system finds or creates a Topic matching the Unit name
   - The resource is associated with this Topic
   - The resource maintains a reference to its Unit

### How Resources are Displayed
1. In the Student Dashboard:
   - Resources are grouped by Unit
   - Within each Unit, they're organized by Parts and Sections
   - This creates a clear, hierarchical navigation structure

2. In the Learning Interface:
   - Resources specific to the current Topic (Unit) are displayed
   - Assessment activities related to the Topic are shown

## API Endpoints

### Resource Management
- `GET /api/subjects/:subjectId/resources`
  - Returns all resources for a subject
  - Organized by unit structure
  - Includes creator information

- `POST /api/resources`
  - Creates a new resource
  - Associates it with the appropriate Topic/Unit
  - Handles file uploads if necessary

- `GET /api/topics/:topicId/resources`
  - Returns resources for a specific Topic
  - Used in the learning interface

### Structure Management
- `GET /api/subjects/:subjectId/structure`

## Common Operations

### Adding a Resource
1. Teacher selects a subject
2. Chooses a unit, part, and section
3. Uploads or links the resource
4. System:
   - Creates/finds Topic matching the Unit
   - Associates resource with Topic
   - Maintains unit/part/section organization

### Viewing Resources
1. Student accesses their enrolled subject
2. System:
   - Loads subject structure
   - Retrieves resources
   - Organizes them by unit/part/section
   - Displays in hierarchical view

## Notes

- Topics serve as a bridge between Units and Resources
- This structure allows for:
  - Flexible resource organization
  - Clear navigation hierarchy
  - Efficient resource retrieval
  - Proper content organization
