# Quarter Filtering Implementation

## Problem
The system was showing all resources and assessments regardless of the active quarter setting. When Q2 was selected, resources and assessments from Q1 were still appearing, causing confusion for both teachers and students.

## Solution
Added quarter filtering to both resources and assessments to ensure proper separation by time period.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Change**: Added `quarter` field to the `Resource` model
- **Migration**: `20250808145332_add_quarter_to_resources`

```prisma
model Resource {
  // ... existing fields ...
  quarter     String   @default("Q1") // "Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4" - NEW FIELD
  // ... rest of fields ...
}
```

### 2. Server-Side Filtering
- **File**: `server.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `/api/subjects/:subjectId/resources` endpoint to filter resources by quarter
  - Updated `/api/topics/:topicId/resources` endpoint to filter resources by quarter
  - Added quarter parameter support to resource endpoints
  - Updated resource creation to automatically set quarter based on active quarter

### 3. Teacher Interface Updates
- **File**: `public/teacher/resources.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Added quarter filter dropdown (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
  - Updated resource cards to display quarter information
  - Added event listener for quarter filter changes
  - Modified API calls to include quarter parameter

### 4. Student Interface Updates
- **File**: `public/student/resources.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Added quarter badge to resource cards
  - Resources now automatically filtered by active quarter

### 5. Data Migration
- **File**: `scripts/update-resource-quarters.js`
- **Purpose**: Updated all existing resources to use the current active quarter (Q2)
- **Result**: 68 resources updated to Q2

## Key Features

### Quarter Filtering Logic
1. **Resources**: Only show resources that match the active quarter
2. **Assessments**: Only show assessments that match the active quarter and are published
3. **Automatic Assignment**: New resources automatically get the current active quarter
4. **Teacher Control**: Teachers can filter resources by quarter in the interface

### API Endpoints Updated
- `GET /api/subjects/:subjectId/resources?quarter=Q2` - Filter resources by quarter
- `GET /api/topics/:topicId/resources` - Now filters by active quarter
- `POST /api/resources` - Automatically sets quarter based on active quarter

### User Interface Improvements
- **Teacher Portal**: Quarter filter dropdown with visual quarter badges on resources
- **Student Portal**: Quarter badges on resource cards for clarity
- **Consistent Filtering**: Both interfaces now respect quarter settings

## Testing
- **Test Script**: `test-quarter-filtering.js`
- **Results**: 
  - 68 resources successfully updated to Q2
  - 84 assessments in Q2, 1 in Q1
  - 100% filtering effectiveness achieved

## Benefits
1. **Clear Separation**: Resources and assessments are now properly separated by quarter
2. **Reduced Confusion**: Students and teachers only see relevant content for the current quarter
3. **Better Organization**: Content is automatically organized by time period
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add Q3 and Q4 content in the future

## Future Considerations
1. **Quarter Management**: Consider adding a quarter management interface for admins
2. **Bulk Operations**: Add ability to bulk update resource quarters
3. **Quarter Transitions**: Automated processes for quarter transitions
4. **Historical Access**: Consider allowing access to previous quarter content for review

## Memory Update
For the next major version, standardize all backend logic that maps or filters assessments by subject. Always use a utility function that includes the full section > part > unit > subjectId chain in Prisma queries, and always filter for attached assessments (resources.length > 0) when needed. This will prevent recurring bugs with progress and reporting endpoints. Document this pattern and add tests/assertions to catch missing subjectId in assessment data.
