# Login Activity Tracking System

## Overview

The Login Activity Tracking system helps teachers identify and report on **active students** who log into the learning system but don't produce any activity (assessment submissions). This is crucial for parent communication and intervention strategies. **Inactive students are automatically excluded from all reports and analysis.**

## Key Features

### 1. **Engagement Pattern Analysis**
The system categorizes students into different engagement patterns:

- **Always Active**: 100% of login sessions result in activity
- **Highly Engaged**: 75%+ of login sessions result in activity
- **Moderately Engaged**: 50-74% of login sessions result in activity
- **Low Engagement**: 25-49% of login sessions result in activity
- **Minimal Engagement**: <25% of login sessions result in activity
- **Login Only - No Activity**: Logs in but never produces activity
- **No Logins**: Hasn't logged in during the analysis period

### 2. **Activity Rate Calculation**
```
Activity Rate = (Sessions with Activity / Total Login Sessions) × 100
```

### 3. **Session-Level Tracking**
- Tracks each individual login session
- Identifies sessions that didn't result in assessment submissions
- Records session duration, IP address, and timestamps

### 4. **Active Student Filtering**
- Automatically excludes inactive students from all reports
- Focuses analysis on students who are currently enrolled and active
- Ensures reports are relevant for current intervention strategies

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Identify Students Needing Intervention**
```javascript
// Get students with "Login Only - No Activity" pattern
const criticalStudents = students.filter(s => 
    s.engagementPattern === 'Login Only - No Activity'
);

// Get students with low engagement
const lowEngagementStudents = students.filter(s => 
    s.activityRate < 25
);
```

### 2. **Generate Parent Reports**
```javascript
// Generate report for specific student
const student = students.find(s => s.id === studentId);
const report = generateParentReport(student);

// Export report
downloadReport(report, `parent-report-${student.name}.txt`);
```

### 3. **Track Engagement Trends**
```javascript
// Compare engagement over different time periods
const last7Days = await fetch('/api/teacher/login-without-activity?days=7');
const last30Days = await fetch('/api/teacher/login-without-activity?days=30');

// Analyze trends
const trendAnalysis = compareEngagementTrends(last7Days, last30Days);
```

## Technical Implementation

### Active Student Filtering
The system automatically filters out inactive students to focus on currently enrolled students:

```javascript
// Get only active students with sessions and submissions
const students = await prisma.user.findMany({
    where: { 
        role: 'STUDENT',
        active: true  // Only include active students
    },
    include: {
        sessions: {
            where: {
                startTime: { gte: daysAgo }
            }
        },
        assessmentSubmissions: {
            where: {
                submittedAt: { gte: daysAgo }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### Activity Rate Calculation
```javascript
const activityRate = totalLoginSessions > 0 ? 
    ((sessionsWithActivity / totalLoginSessions) * 100).toFixed(1) : 0;
```

### Engagement Pattern Logic
```javascript
if (totalLoginSessions === 0) {
    engagementPattern = 'No Logins';
} else if (sessionsWithoutActivity === 0) {
    engagementPattern = 'Always Active';
} else if (sessionsWithoutActivity === totalLoginSessions) {
    engagementPattern = 'Login Only - No Activity';
} else if (activityRate >= 75) {
    engagementPattern = 'Highly Engaged';
} else if (activityRate >= 50) {
    engagementPattern = 'Moderately Engaged';
} else if (activityRate >= 25) {
    engagementPattern = 'Low Engagement';
} else {
    engagementPattern = 'Minimal Engagement';
}
```
